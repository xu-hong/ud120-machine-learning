   You know what Cooper, don't worry about it.  Chrissy said she can give
   me a boost.  Her booster cables are in her Jeep so it is probably easier
   for her than for you.

   Thanks for the advice though.  I will still buy you BI!

   I think you are right about the 30 minute rule.  I should have let it
   run longer.

   I'm not parked on a hill.  My jeep is out front of my apt.

   Would you consider giving me a boost?  I would really appreciate it.  So
   much, in fact, that I would buy you Burger Inn next time we went (if we
   ever go)

   i think you didn't let it run long enough after your boost.  i think 30
   minutes is the rule of thumb when you're battery is drained.  not
   turning
   over at all is not a good sign - one thing you can do is park on a hill
   when you're in doubt and then you can roll-start your jeep (if you have
   a
   standard) if you didn't let it charge long enough - if the battery is
   really, really dead, though, this won't work.  where's your jeep now?

      I left my headlights on overnight on Sunday.  When I went to start my
      Jeep on Monday, the battery was dead.  I got a boost but only let it
   run
      for about 5 minutes.  I shut it off and then re-started it - I
   thought
      everything was fine.  When I went to start it last night - same
   thing.
      Didn't even turn over.  I don't know if I wrecked my battery or if I
      need a new alternator.  Or maybe I didn't let it run for long enough
      after my boost.

      Jai says you are very mechanically inclined - any advice?
