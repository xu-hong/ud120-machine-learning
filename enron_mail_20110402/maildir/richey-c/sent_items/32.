i've been doing nothing for two months (literally) and should be trading again in a few weeks, so i've got to start preparing for that, which is a welcome change.  

what do you mean you're not doing anything this w/e?  i like the bar scene alot, but i have to be drunk to enjoy it.  i think one night a week its good if you have nothing better to do.  i think some of the boys from enron are going out this sat. if you end up having nothing to do.  we'll be moving in this w/e, you should come by and check it out.  

as for chrissy, that was the sound of my cock puncturing the desk and knocking my mouse on its side.  

dingy pub would have been good - do you have a favorite?  i like the auburn saloon, but jai hates it. so ...  it took us *forever* to get out of the parking lot.  brutal.

SDC,

I will have a 1/4 pound hamburger (I think) with ketchup, mustard, pickles, lettuce, and onions (wanna neck).  No mayo,tomato, or cheese.  I will have fries and a coke with that please!

This week-end probably not doing too much.  I like to hang out - not much for the whole bar scene.  You?

How will things at work be changing?

Yep, Chrissy is a very pretty/cute girl.  She's very horny too.  Oh..was that the sound of your cock hitting the underneath of your desk?

Sorry about Lucky.  The 4 of us should have gone to some dingy little pub and drank ourselves silly.  That would have been fun, huh?

auntie,

what are you having at burger inn?

it has been too long - we'll have to fix it.  what are you doing this w/e?

i feel like i've been sick for two weeks, and i haven't been doing much,
mostly taking care of errands etc since i don't have much to do at work
these days.  hopefully that will be changing soon.

um, chrissy is much too cute to be playing with her toys alone.

i'm not sure why lucky sucked - i think it was the crowd we met up with
there.  you two should have come and it would have been more fun i'm sure.

   SDC,

   Sunday it is then.  I already know what I'm going to have!

   It was really great to see you on Saturday.  It has been much too long.
   What have you been doing with yourself?

   We didn't end up hitting Cowboys.  We were both a little tired and a lot
   cold.  I went home and watched a little t.v and it's a sure bet that
   Chrissy went home and played with her toys!

   Why was Lucky so terrible?

   Auntie
