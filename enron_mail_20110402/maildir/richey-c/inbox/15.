I left my headlights on overnight on Sunday.  When I went to start my Jeep on Monday, the battery was dead.  I got a boost but only let it run for about 5 minutes.  I shut it off and then re-started it - I thought everything was fine.  When I went to start it last night - same thing.  Didn't even turn over.  I don't know if I wrecked my battery or if I need a new alternator.  Or maybe I didn't let it run for long enough after my boost.

Jai says you are very mechanically inclined - any advice?
