hmmm, excellent point.  That little sicko might bust me.

I could leave beaver tracks on his bed sheets?

   Cooper,

   ha ha!  Peeing on Jai's toilet seat would be hilarious (gross, but
   hilarious).  Maybe I will spray some yellow lemonade on the seat just so
   he THINKS that I peed on it.

   It could be Auntie and SDC's private joke!

   auntie:

   i think it will be easy to get back into the swing of thigns -- sitting
   on
   my ass for two months has been a nice distraction, but its gotten really
   boring.  trading is exciting and i'm looking forward to it - should be
   like
   jumping into a cold pool.  i'm actually doing real work lately which is
   great.  i still have no idea what you do at work.  anything interesting?

   yes, the new babe lair should be sweet - we'll need auntie's
   recommendations.  just make sure you shit in jai's toilet.  it might be
   harder for you than me, but peeing on the toilet seat is always a good
   way
   to get your message across - as a woman, i think it would send an
   especially clear signal.  are you stopping by this weekend?  i'm having
   a
   couch delivered on sat between 10 and 2, so i think we'll be around then
   for sure.

   5 times a day is no problem, but 5 times a day seven days a week might
   be a
   push, but with the right stimulation anything is possible.  is chrissy a
   5x7 kind of chick?  wow.  and, of course, retention is always an
   interesting experiment.

   we'll have to go to big wally's - especially if its not my style.  i
   haven't spent much time in kensington, but it seems like there are some
   good spots there.

      Do you think it will be hard to get back into the "swing of things"?
      You know how it is when you return to work after holidays and it
   takes
      forever for the day to pass or for Friday to arrive?

      I am looking forward to seeing the new babe lair.  I will have to
   think
      of a very cool housewarming gift.  Oh yeah....you guys didn't buy ME
      anything.  Maybe I will just come by and take a dip in the pool and
      leave a shit in your toilet.

      Yikes!!!  Chrissy would llliiiikkkkeeee you.  Are you "up" to it 5
   times
      a day?

      I like Big Wally's in Kensington.  Ever been there?  I'm not sure
   it's
      your style.  Ugly waitresses and a hundred degree above heat but I
   like
      it.  Always packed and a interesting variety of music.  I've never
   been
      to the Auburn Saloon.

      Eagerly awaiting a response.  Write SOON!

      Auntie

      i've been doing nothing for two months (literally) and should be
   trading
      again in a few weeks, so i've got to start preparing for that, which
   is
      a
      welcome change.

      what do you mean you're not doing anything this w/e?  i like the bar
      scene
      alot, but i have to be drunk to enjoy it.  i think one night a week
   its
      good if you have nothing better to do.  i think some of the boys from
      enron
      are going out this sat. if you end up having nothing to do.  we'll be
      moving in this w/e, you should come by and check it out.

      as for chrissy, that was the sound of my cock puncturing the desk and
      knocking my mouse on its side.

      dingy pub would have been good - do you have a favorite?  i like the
      auburn
      saloon, but jai hates it. so ...  it took us *forever* to get out of
   the
      parking lot.  brutal.

         SDC,

         I will have a 1/4 pound hamburger (I think) with ketchup, mustard,
         pickles, lettuce, and onions (wanna neck).  No mayo,tomato, or
      cheese.
         I will have fries and a coke with that please!

         This week-end probably not doing too much.  I like to hang out -
   not
         much for the whole bar scene.  You?

         How will things at work be changing?

         Yep, Chrissy is a very pretty/cute girl.  She's very horny too.
      Oh..was
         that the sound of your cock hitting the underneath of your desk?

         Sorry about Lucky.  The 4 of us should have gone to some dingy
   little
         pub and drank ourselves silly.  That would have been fun, huh?

         auntie,

         what are you having at burger inn?

         it has been too long - we'll have to fix it.  what are you doing
   this
         w/e?

         i feel like i've been sick for two weeks, and i haven't been doing
      much,
         mostly taking care of errands etc since i don't have much to do at
      work
         these days.  hopefully that will be changing soon.

         um, chrissy is much too cute to be playing with her toys alone.

         i'm not sure why lucky sucked - i think it was the crowd we met up
      with
         there.  you two should have come and it would have been more fun
   i'm
         sure.

            Sunday it is then.  I already know what I'm going to have!

            It was really great to see you on Saturday.  It has been much
   too
         long.
            What have you been doing with yourself?

            We didn't end up hitting Cowboys.  We were both a little tired
   and
      a
         lot
            cold.  I went home and watched a little t.v and it's a sure bet
      that
            Chrissy went home and played with her toys!

            Why was Lucky so terrible?

            Auntie

   make
      it
         a
            tradition.

            great to see you on sat. night.  lucky was unbelievably lame.
      yawn.

            how did the night go?  end up at cowboys?
